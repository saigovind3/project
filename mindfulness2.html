What Is Meditation? And What Is
It Not?
For many people, the word
"meditation" conjures up images of
hippies in tie-dyed shirts or Buddhist
monks dressed in orange sitting
cross-legged, forefingers clasped
in a circle, while chanting "ohm."
Incense sticks and sounds bowls
may be thrown in there too.
Let's look more closely at some of
the stereotypes and misconceptions
associated with meditation
Many think of meditation as a
religious activity associated with
Buddhism, Hinduism, and other
religions. While many practitioners
of these religions do, in fact,
practice meditation, meditation itself
is not inherently religious.
Modern mindfulness meditation is
a fancy way of paying attention to
what's going on right now, in this
moment. It's also concerned with
working toward accepting what's
going on right here, right now
without wanting to change anything.
It asks the questions: What dol
see? What do I hear? What do l
feel? What sensations do I have
in my body? It is an exercise in
concentration and acceptance,
and is a way to build these muscles
in the brain. There is nothing
inherently religious about it.
