Autopilot Thinking
Do you remember how you learned
to ride a bike? At first, it was hard.
It took a lot of effort-balancing on
the bike while coordinating your
feet and hand movements to be
able to go forward and stop. It took
concentration and physical effort.
 After much practice and a few
falls, though, your brain and
body eventually internalized the
processes. Today, you ride a
bike on autopilot, not needing
to think about all the ways you're
coordinating different movements
and working muscles.
