  Depression can change regular
ways of thinking. For many, this
means increased thoughts about
death whether in a general sense
such as contemplating the finite
nature of life or thinking more
specifically such as about people
who have died. Thoughts of one's
own death from suicide or even
an accident or illness can also be
quite common.

 During a depressive episode,
feelings of hopelessness, despair,
sadness, or inner emptiness
can be overwhelming. Thinking
processes can also slow or be less
productive, making it difficult to
find solutions to problems. With all
this, it is not surprising that some
people think of death as a way out
when suffering with depression.
   
 The good news here is that
there are strategies that have
proven successful for mitigating
suicidal thoughts. This course
will introduce you to some that
can relieve you in the short term.
There are many more that can
help in the long run that you can
learn in therapy with the support
of a mental health practitioner.
Having an emergency plan in
place when suicidal thoughts
come up can be an important first
step, which is the focus of the next
chapter. The chapters that follow
will take you through some of the
short-term strategies to help deter
suicidal thoughts.
