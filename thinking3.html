        <p>.Dealing With Suicidal Thoughts (sub heading)

            The thoughts that run through
           your mind, which are based in
           part on your perceptions and
           interpretations, can greatly impact
           your feelings. You've likely already
           observed this. If your boss walks
           past you without saying hello, you
           may think: "Oh, she didn't say
           hello. She must be angry at me
           for that projectI didn't do well
           last week." The resultant feelingg
           is dismay or sadness. Something
           happened. You perceived this
           happening and then interpreted
           the reasons for it. Feelings rose up
           in response to these thoughts.
           
           
             But, importantly, perceptions
           and interpretations can be
           re-examined for accuracy and
           can change as a result. With
           the changing thoughts come
           changing feelings. Let's say your
           boss walks past you without
           saying hello. You notice this then
           at first think it is because she is
           angry with you, but a few minutes
           later a colleague tells you that
           the boss had gotten into a car
           accident on the way to work. You
           realize that your initial thought,
           then, is likely not true and instead
           she was probably just upset and
           distracted about the car accident.
           Your feelings switch from your
           own sadness about a perceived
           slight to empathy for your boss
           and what she had gone through.
