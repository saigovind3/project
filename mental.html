            There are times in life when things
go well and when they go badly.
In good phases, we are optimistic
and content. We feel able to tackle
our daily tasks.
During difficult phases, though, we
are sad or even despairing and may
feel like we can't face the things
we're supposed to do.
At these low points, many of us have
developed our own strategies to
move torward and quickly recover.
A depression isn't "just" severe
sadness. It doesn't just affect our
emotions, but our entire life.
With a depression these usual
strategies just don't seem to work
any longer. We find it hard to cope
and tackle the negative phase we
are experiencing.


Depression has direct physical
effects. Contrary to what we may be
told, these are not "imaginary." They
are quite real and must be taken
into account during treatment
These include:
Lack of energy and sudden
exhaustion
Changes in appetite
Changes in sleep
Loss of sexual desire
Pain or other physical symptoms
