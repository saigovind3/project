            Studies show that one in three
adults occasionally have problems
with sleep.
Approximately, one in ten,
though, deal with chronic
problems with sleep.
When you don't sleep or don't
sleep well, your mood, thinking,
and ability to perform tasks well
diminish.

 One of the frustrations of
consistently not being able to
go to sleep or stay asleep can
stem, ironically, from knowing the
importance of sleep. Most of us
know, for example, that sleep is a
restorative period that allows our
brains and bodies to rejuvenate,
leading to better health, mental
acuity, and mood
So when we want to be sleeping
but can't, we often make it worse
by angsting about the importance
of the thing that eludes us-sleep.



A healthy sleep goes through
repeated cycles throughout
the night, a phenomenon sleep
specialists refer to as "sleep
architecture."

Phase One: Very Light Sleep
When we first go to bed, we fall
into a very light sleep, a kind of
"dozing." Our brain activity lowers
and our muscles slowly come to
rest, sometimes twitching.
When awakened while in this
phase, people often feel like they
were already awake. Or if most
of the night is spent in this sleep
phase, a person often wakes up
feeling like they haven't slept "at


 Phase Two: Deep Sleep
Once this light phase passes,
sleep becomes deeper and
deeper as we enter the "deep
sleep phase. As the name
implies, it's harder to wake up
while in this phase.
Here, brain activity is slower than
in light sleep, and autonomic
activities (e.g., heartbeat,
breathing, muscle tension) run on
a low flame.
This sleep stage promotes our
physical recovery, and is when
Our immune and metabolic
systems regenerate.


 Phase Three: REM Sleep
After about 90 minutes in the
deep sleep phase, we move into
our first REM sleep phase. "REM
stands for "Rapid Eye Movement,"
the fast eye movements typical for
this sleep phase.
The brain and autonomic activities
increase, even approaching that
of the awake state at times. Our
muscles, however, are temporarily
paralyzed as the brain spends this
time processing and trimming
down unnecessary synaptic
connections created throughout
the day.
