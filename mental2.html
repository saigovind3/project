            The need for belonging and
connection is universal. People
want to be liked and appreciated,
acknowledged and accepted,
and feel secure in their social
environment.
As early as kindergarten, kids are
concerned with who belongs and
who does not. Painful experiences
and memories can, under certain
circumstances, promote the
development of Social Anxiety
Disorder, a chronic mental health
condition where social interactions
are perceived as threatening and
cause (severe) fear and anxiety.




Psychotherapy and medication
have both proven to be effective
in the treatment of Social Anxiety
Disorder. It might help to work
one-on-one with a therapist at first
and, once you feel comfortable,
join a group setting. The latter
is particularly helpful if your
therapist decides on a plan that
includes getting more exposure to
situations where you interact with
others in a safe environment
The goal of any treatment will
be to reduce your anxiety to the
point that you can cope better
with everyday life and feel more
relaxed and comfortable while
hanging out with friends or
participating in group activities.
You're also likely to learn how to
reduce the risk of a relapse.
A mental health practitioner will
help you develop a treatment
plan that's right for you. If you are
unclear about anything, be sure to
ask questions.
Regardless of whether you choose
therapy or medication, you will
need to actively participate to
see progress.
