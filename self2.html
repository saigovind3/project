            Insomnia is defined as difficulty
falling asleep or staying asleep,
even when a person has a chance
to do so. It's a pretty complicated
condition since there are many
potential causes for this.
Common Symptoms of
Insomnia
 If you often feel dissatisfied
with your sleep and consistently
experience tatigue, Iow energy,
difficulty concentrating,
disturbances in your mood, and
decreased performance either
at work or school, it's possible
you're experiencing the effects of
Insomnia

 Acute or Chronic?
Insomnia is a common sleep
problem tor adults. It can be acute
and temporary (like the night

it can be chronic (happening three

Coziness

When preparing your environment
for sleep, consider this principle:
 Your bed and entire bedroom
have only one task-to get you to
sleep comfortably. To that end,
there are many ways to adjust your
room that are conducive to sleep.
Consider

*Make your room a haven.
Use dim lighting in the
evening.

*Be sure the temperature is
comfortable.


*When possible, allow your
room to have fresh air.


*Keep noises to a minimum
in your room while trying to
sleep.



Function of a Sleep Ritual
Sending children to bed in the
evening without a routine or ritual
would be pretty hard. By reading
to them or singing a lullaby, we
help them adjust to sleep and fall
asleep more easily.
What we do with our children,
though, we often neglect for
ourselves. Sleep rituals are also
important for adults as they help
us, too, prepare for sleep.
So it's high time we got the sleep
ritual back. And this is exactly what
this chapter is about. Together
we will put together your own
personal sleep ritual.
